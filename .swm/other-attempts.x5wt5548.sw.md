- To predict the trend of each stock for the next five days, the model takes into account the past forty days. After training for 200 epochs, two losses are computed, one for classification and one for regression.&nbsp;
- Using backpropagation, two losses are combined to update the transformerâ€™s weights. To determine if multi-tasking improves results, another transformer model with only classification tasks is also developed.
