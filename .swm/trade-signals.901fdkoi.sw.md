title: Trade Signals

Profitable trades occur when the upward or downward trend predicted by the model lasts longer than the forecasting horizon.

The multiple forecasting horizons can include short forecasting horizons (e.g., 26 and 27), which are shorter than the main forecasting horizon (e.g., 28 in strategy 1) to reduce the chance of falsely flagging a trading opportunity.

&nbsp;signals have magnitude

- when trading signals are combined (aggregated) and their absolute values are taken, the relationship (correlation) with \[\[Profit and Loss (PnL)\]\] generally strengthens.
- This implies that the sum of multiple signals gives a stronger indication of potential PnL outcomes than individual signals.
- Additionally, we can disregard trading signals below a certain minimum threshold.
